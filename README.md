# DodgeButton
Simple Valheim mod to add a configurable dodge button. Allows you to dodge with a single key press.

### Acknowledgements
Inspired by [1-Key Dodge](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/424) mod on Nexus. This mod is written from scratch though as there is no code available for 1-Key Dodge and no specific license for it.
