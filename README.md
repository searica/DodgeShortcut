# DodgeShortcut
Simple Valheim mod to add a configurable dodge button. Allows you to dodge with a single key press.

### Acknowledgements
Inspired by [1-Key Dodge](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/424) mod on Nexus. This mod is written from scratch though as there is no code available for 1-Key Dodge and no specific license for it.

## Useage
Install the mod, run the game once to create the configuration file, then 

## Compatibility
Likely compatiable with most mods as it touches very little of the game's code. May conflict with other mods that allow for custom inputs when dodging.

### Contributions
You are welcome to open issues on the Github repository to provide suggestions, feature requests, compatibility issues, and bug reports. Over time I will slowly patch more prefabs and hopefully come up with a more generalizable method of patching them, but if you'd really like a specific prefab to work better just open an issue letting me know. I'm a grad student and have a lot of personal responsibilities on top of that so I can't promise I will respond quickly, but I do intend to maintain and improve the mod in my free time.
