# DodgeShortcut
Simple Valheim mod to add a configurable dodge button. Allows you to dodge with a single key press.

### Acknowledgements
Inspired by [1-Key Dodge](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/424) mod on Nexus. This mod is written from scratch though as there is no code available for 1-Key Dodge and no specific license for it.

## Usage
- Install the mod using either r2modman or thunderstore mod manager.
- Run the game once to create the configuration file.
- Either use an in-game configuration manager to edit the default key-bind for dodging or edit the configuration file using your mod manager.
- Press the configured dodge key to dodge in the direction your character is moving, or if they are standing still then the direction your camera is looking.

### Configuration
**EnableMod** [Restart Required]
- Globally enable or disable this mod.
- Default value: true

**DodgeShortcut**
- Set the key to press to dodge in the direction your character is moving. If LeftAlt conflicts with other mods, I recommend setting the dodge key to the back button on your mouse.
- Default value: LeftAlt       

## Compatibility
Likely compatiable with most mods as it touches very little of the game's code. May conflict with other mods that allow for custom inputs when dodging.

### Contributions
You are welcome to open issues on the Github repository to provide suggestions, feature requests, compatibility issues, and bug reports. Over time I will slowly patch more prefabs and hopefully come up with a more generalizable method of patching them, but if you'd really like a specific prefab to work better just open an issue letting me know. I'm a grad student and have a lot of personal responsibilities on top of that so I can't promise I will respond quickly, but I do intend to maintain and improve the mod in my free time.
